# TicTacToe game with Q-Learning

Aim of this project to build a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm (QLearning) that can play tic tac toe 
better than a human does.

When program is run, the agent starts playing against a dummy agent. The agent's moves are backed by QTable, while
the dummy agent always makes random moves.
