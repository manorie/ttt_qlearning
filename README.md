# TicTacToe game with Double Q-Learning

Aim of this project to build a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm (QLearning) that can play tic tac toe 
better than a human does. When application runs, agent starts playing agains in two other agents. One opponent agent picks highly random moves while the other one makes a bit smarter moves.

At the same time you can play against the agent, by using numbers on the board between [0, 8]. 0 refers to the (1, 1) cell in the tictactoe board while 8 refers to (3, 3).
